    "## Understanding Sentiment Analysis and RNNs\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. It identifies whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Feedback: Understanding customer opinions about products or services.\n",
    "- Social Media Monitoring: Gauging public sentiment on social media platforms.\n",
    "- Market Research: Analyzing consumer preferences and trends.\n",
    "- Political Analysis: Assessing public opinion on political matters.\n",
    "- Healthcare: Evaluating patient feedback to improve services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How RNNs Differ from Traditional Feedforward Neural Networks\n",
    "1) Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs):\n",
    "- Data flows in one direction from input to output.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks with independent input data, like image classification.\n",
    "2) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):\n",
    "- Data flows in a loop, allowing the network to retain memory of previous inputs.\n",
    "- Ideal for sequential data where inputs are dependent on previous ones, like language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hidden States and Information Passing in RNNs\n",
    "1) Hidden States: Vectors that store information about previous inputs, acting as the network's memory.\n",
    "2) Information Passing:\n",
    "- Initialization: Starts with a zero vector or a learned parameter.\n",
    "- Update: At each time step, the hidden state is updated based on the current input and the previous hidden state, enabling the network to capture temporal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Issues with RNNs: Vanishing and Exploding Gradients\n",
    "1) Vanishing Gradients:\n",
    "- Problem: Gradients become very small, hindering the network's ability to learn long-term dependencies.\n",
    "- Solution: Use architectures like LSTM or GRU that manage gradients better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Exploding Gradients:\n",
    "- Problem: Gradients become too large, causing instability.\n",
    "- Solution: Apply gradient clipping to limit gradient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these issues, RNNs can effectively learn from sequential data, making them powerful for tasks like sentiment analysis and language modeling."
